# Java Architecture - Core Concepts

## 🧱 Java Platform Overview

Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented programming language. It follows this architecture:


## ⚙️ Components of Java Architecture

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **JDK** | Java Development Kit – includes tools like `javac`, `javadoc`, `javap`, and the JRE |
| **JRE** | Java Runtime Environment – JVM + core libraries |
| **JVM** | Java Virtual Machine – runs `.class` files on your platform |
| **Bytecode** | Intermediate code generated by `javac` |
| **Java** | Language used to write platform-independent code |

---

## 🎯 Why Java is Platform Independent?

- Java code is compiled to **bytecode**, not machine code.
- Bytecode runs on **JVM**, which is platform-specific.
- So you write once, and run anywhere JVM is available.

## 🔥 Real-World Analogy

| Real-world | Java Equivalent |
|------------|-----------------|
| Script in English | Java Code |
| Translated to Spanish | Bytecode |
| Interpreter (Spanish speaker) | JVM |
| Local culture rules | OS (Windows/Linux) |

## 🧠 FAANG-Style Interview Q&A

### ❓ Why is Java platform-independent?
✅ Because Java code is compiled to bytecode, and bytecode runs on any machine with a JVM.

### ❓ What is the role of the JVM?
✅ JVM loads, verifies, and executes Java bytecode on the host system.

### ❓ What does JDK include?
✅ JDK = JRE + development tools like compiler, debugger, etc.
